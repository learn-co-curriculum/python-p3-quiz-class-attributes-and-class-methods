# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```ruby
class Book:

  genres = []

  def __init__ (self, title, author = "", page_count = 0):
    self.title = title self.author = author self.page_count = page_count

  def genre(self, genre): return GENRE
```

Every time a genre is added to a `Book` object, we want to store that genre in
the class variable named genres. The code above doesn't currently do this.
Select the code snippet that does.

## Correct

```ruby
class Book:

  genres = []

  def __init__ (self, title, author = "", page_count = 0):
    self.title = title self.author = author self.page_count = page_count

  def genre(cls, genre): return cls.genres.append(genre)
```

> Wow! Nailed it!! By calling `cls.genres.append` adding the genre to `genres`, we
> achieve exactly what we want.

## Incorrect

```ruby
class Book:

  genres = []

  def __init__ (self, title, author = "", page_count = 0):
    self.title = title self.author = author self.page_count = page_count

  def genre(cls, genre): return genres.append(genre)
```

> This isn't actually adding the genre to `genres`. Is there something missing?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
