# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```python
class Book:

  genres = []

  def __init__ (self, title, author = "", page_count = 0):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author
    self.page_count = page_count

  def genre(self, genre):
    genres.append(genre)
```

Every time a genre is added to a `Book` object, we want to store that genre in
the class variable named genres. The code above doesn't currently do this.
Select the code snippet that does.

## Correct

```python
class Book:

  genres = []

  def __init__ (self, title, author = "", page_count = 0):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author
    self.page_count = page_count

  @classmethod
  def genre(cls, genre):
    cls.genres.append(genre)
```

> Wow! Nailed it!! By calling `cls.genres.append` adding the genre to `genres`,
> we achieve exactly what we want.

## Incorrect

```python
class Book:

  genres = []

  def __init__ (self, title, author = "", page_count = 0):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author
    self.page_count = page_count

  @classmethod
  def genre(cls, genre):
    genres.append(genre)
```

> This isn't actually adding the genre to `genres`. Is there something missing?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
