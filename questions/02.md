# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```ruby
class MyClass: @classmethod def class_method_name(cls):
    # some code
```

In this code sample, what does the keyword `cls` refer to?

## Correct

The entire `MyClass` class itself.

> Perfect! `cls` is being used inside the class itself, so it refers to the class.

## Incorrect

An instance of the class.

> Where is `cls` being used? Is it inside an instance method or inside the class?

## Incorrect

Global scope.

> Where is `cls` being used? Is it inside the class or just floating around in the
> file not nested in any other code?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
